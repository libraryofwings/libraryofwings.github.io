		<h3><b>On Recognizing Value in Ourselves</b></h3>
		<p>Today’s world is logical, orderly, neat. There are boundaries, and they will remain. At least that is what we wish to believe. Truthfully, our beloved order and reason are at best three emotions in a trench coat - chaos - but scooped into little muddied piles we assign a meaning and a schematic shortcut. Playing in the sand, we draw lines and yet somehow can’t comprehend the waves that not only threaten but will wash over our fragile playthings. When our minds are shored here - our foundations - we are at a loss; this inconsiderate rhythm of the world and the deep foundations of humanity’s collective consciousness breathe together and drive us in ways we would not.</p>
		<p>One of these schemas is value. Inherent value. Earned value. Adding value, recouping value, driving value. In our culture, directors and businessmen love to talk about it, chattering and congregating as magpies around a shiny piece of foil. What is value? Can we hoard it? Can we grow it? Unfortunately as our childish intelligence drives us beyond the simple joy of a magpie, we deck ourselves in foil trappings of our own making, and fall into dismay when the wind snatches it from our backs. Humanity, and I speak of myself as well, has an unhealthy fixation on proving worth in the coldest and most numerical of ways.</p>
		<p>As we further convict ourselves of the sanctity of reason, the foundations of our collective psyche become distant. Why are we here? What are we worth? Am I esteemed any higher than a fresh pile of dung? Or indeed, am I worse? For at least the dung provides feed for beetles and insects, nutrients to the grass and weeds, and a feasting board to the birds that pick through the grubs and sprouts. The dung pile breathes life, and I- what do I breathe? Corruption and lies. I contribute nothing but entropy, a testament as I break down and age to the inevitability of death. I am a monument to what could have been, but even myself I am unsure of what that is.</p>
		<p>Without numbers, it seems hazy and unjustified to attribute any sort of value to my being. Strangely, there is no struggle to justify that from any other human being, or even an animal. The timid mouse does not have to hit growth metrics on his stock portfolio for me to nod and sagely say that he is worthy of life, that he may eat another day, subject to re-evaluation tomorrow. I see him and consider what he is - his movements - breathing - watching his mind turn and the pleasure twitches as he grooms himself in the sun. Dashing - watching - rarely still. To know him is a pleasure, and he does not look to me for approval, and that in itself bows my head with respect.</p>
		<p>Why, then, do we apply this distorted template, abstract yet somehow infuriatingly concrete, to ourselves? I speak for myself when I admit, as an animal revealing a wound, inflamed and worried by fuss and grooming, that I am holding my breath, waiting. I wait for approval, to be considered by someone as worthy. They will look at my metrics, my accomplishments, the fragile sand lines we collectively decided upon, and will nod. I may eat.  I dash and quickly devour my share - no more - do not exceed the bounds that have been set for me, lest I encounter snarls driving me back, scorn, then my permission will be revoked - another hungry day. I confine myself so that others will not have to, instead, that they will pity me and lead me to drink, eat, hand over what I deserve on a gilded platter. Then, I can tell myself, I am worthy, for it has been decided, and I will humbly receive.</p>
		<p>The deep corruption present in this false humility is indeed a form of pride. I absolve myself of my sins, even the possibility of wrong, by deflecting responsibility. Ah, my seat here, my food and drink? No, no, you are mistaken; I did not take it, I was given. Ask the one that sent me here, for he granted it to me. I am so sincerely sorry, for my transgression, but it was not of myself. I make myself pure by stripping away my agency, a little lamb may not sin, for it knows not what that is. Yet the lamb knows that its heart is black, infectious, weeping, and its skin may burst under pressure and the heart will vomit out all the anger and entitlement that broiled under the snowy fleece.</p>
		<p>The answers I have to this unstable situation are tenuous at best, but I believe in my scarlet, living heart, somewhere beyond the blackness, that one’s spotless wool must be sullied if the infection is to be purged. Mistakes - offenses - transgressions; all must be owned, committed, albeit with due solemnity, puncture wounds in the chest draining all the corruption in a painful death to the world. Then, perhaps, one can stand in defiance, marred, dirtied, but in honesty and self-acceptance. I am here - I do not exist to be weighed and judged by others - I simply am.</p>
		<p>Seasons pass -  the mouse grooms himself in the sun - no one watches. Yet he continues in contentment. Some may disapprove, shrieking about dirty mice in their kitchens, but he at least does not commit the sin of holding back and making himself small to be loved. He is who he is. You are who you are.</p>

		<h3>Grief as an Immigrant, or Starting Over</h3>
		<p>While far from a unique realization, I find it a pressing matter, and one previously foreign to my mind. I was raised with caring parents and a sense of understanding of the land, my place in it, and the natural rhythm of a local ecosystem I now realize was fragile - if not temporary. To me, this was life. I had little understanding, though plenty of knowledge, of other ways and beings. To the stranger in a strange land, I had sympathy, but no empathy. That was an Other, the fate of people who I was not and never would be. I took for granted this soil, the roots that held me firmly, and the system of friends and family that kept my confidence and grew warmth in the rather terrifying endless sprawl of the universe, of which we were a mere speck. It was Home, and it was mine.</p>
		<p>I lived on a small farm, and spent my days engaged with observation. It was, and still is, how I ground myself in the physical paths of being, and if I am being honest, my purpose in life. I give homage to that which is worthy and true by being an observer, a testament of beauty by seeking to write and create and sing and tell stories about what I see and touch. I am a cataloguer, a librarian by nature. I treasure the things I know, file them as if bejeweled beetles in the collection of a tender naturalist. While this has led me to an interest and a career in sciences and engineering, my treasures are not limited to such. Just as I may delight in collecting understanding of mathematic principles and thermodynamic tables, so also the different plants that bud in fresh seasons, the ways my little flock of chickens express their opinions, and how wind tangles the branches on the trees only to slip free - one instant overwriting the next, but I know. I was there. It means I am alive, for I bring the past into the present, keeping it alive too. It is said you are not dead until you are forgotten. Many creatures and plants whose structures are now become dust, returned to endless potential, dance ghostly in my mind - living - saying “I am here, do not forget me.” I suppose I also wish that, to be known by those I love, and who love me too.</p>
		<p>This place I called Home, was the place I stored my treasures. As much as I could hold, my cup overflowed in this admittedly rather geographically limited place. Every day - a new leaf unfurled, a buck dropped his antlers in the woods, unseen, I must know, oh, I must see - endless - new worlds blooming every day, I would never cease to wonder. And then - one day, which began as any other day - I left.</p>
		<p>I am the stranger in a strange land now, with unfamiliar language, I do not recognize even the trees and lands. Cars whizz past now, and my desperate attempts to put down roots are stopped by the concrete floors, unfeeling, unyielding, loud, many lights and machines of advertising, buy this, spend this, we sell happiness, we sell contentment. Yet there is less of it here than - boundless - running freely in rivers I knew of old. I know one day this too will become my home, and I will know the moss growing in the sidewalk, and the mistletoe tangles over the paths at the park, how they sway in the wind and grow. But the grief remains. I am circling for a place to land, but the waters seem dark, and I know I will rest one day, but when? Regardless of peace that I know will return one day, it is not the same, nor will it ever be. I have left the place of my beginnings, and I will never return. Now it exists in my memory, and has become another bittersweet jeweled beetle in my collection.</p>
		<p>I left for good reason, to be united again with another whom I loved so dearly that knowledge of him was richer to me than even all these woods and paths I loved so well. To know and be with another soul, let me not downplay it, I left of my own will. I understand some do not have that choice. But this path is mine. I do not regret it, but the grief pierces me all the same. In an instant, I lost my life, my home. I told myself I may return whenever it pleases me, but the waters have shifted, and become sickly. The home I knew - it is there, in all the renewing woods, the little creatures still flashing between logs, stumps, and rocks. Yet, what it means to me has changed irrevocably. Since I left, I no longer recognize my home. It is corrupted by evil, and I feel crushed by the knowledge I can never return. If I go back, it will not be as it was. It is alive still in my mind, but I cannot renew it, for it has since passed. I am a wanderer now, finding some respite in many places but never all I thirst for. The door has closed behind me, I know - I accept - but I grieve. I collect pieces of my past, and my present, hoping to build a better future - a collage - a testament to Home, a place of safety and warmth.</p>
		<p>Now we share the faltering light, the warmth of it, huddled away from the endless rain. This is home too, now. I delight in the new spring, but remember wistfully the seasons of the past. I build a monument in my mind, you will not die to me, no, I will remember.</p>
		<p>“May thy sorrows run, and new life spring - lost love, long lament, my fair one, farewell.”</p>
